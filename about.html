        Hello, my name is Fernando and I'm a Digital Media Specialist & FullStack Developer. My first introduction to programming was when I was about 10 years old and took a BASIC Programming Language course. After obtainind my Multimedia Specialization degree and graduating with high honors I have built more websites, interactive CD-ROM's and flash projects that I can count. I've also worked as a Digital Media Specialist in one of the top 10 private Oil & Gas companies in the United States where I manged all their marketing efforts, both digital and print. I relaunched their company website, created their corporate videos and deveveloped a highly customized map from scratch using mapbox API, and JavaScript to showcase their assets in the Gulf of Mexico, additianally I was in charge of creating their booth design and marketing collateral for the annual NAPE Expo in Houston Texas. In 2019 I took a 9-week intensive coding bootcamp learning HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript ES2015, SQL, git, GitHub, Heroku and Ruby on Rails where I designed, implemented and shipped to production a clone of AirBnB and a Rails prototype of https://www.docpat.pro
